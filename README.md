## Private Repos:
### NOS
An operating system written in C and x86 Assembly. Key features include virtual memory (paging), a file system, device drivers (i.e. keyboard drivers), system calls, and process scheduling.
### Tetris-on-FPGA
An original tetris game sythesized onto an FPGA written with SystemVerilog. A thorough report can be found in Tetris-on-FPGA_Report.pdf inside this overview repo.
### OOO_CPU_RISC-V
This repo contains an out-of-order CPU supporting the RISC-V ISA with the M extension written in SystemVerilog. A thorough report can be found in OOO_CPU_Final_Report.pdf inside this overview repo. I created the caches, the cache-line adapter, the age-ordered reservation stations, the cdb arbiter, the commit stage, the split load-store queue, and the cache arbiter.
### Pipelined_CPU_RISC-V
A CPU I created alone with 5 pipeline stages supporting the RISC-V instruction set.
